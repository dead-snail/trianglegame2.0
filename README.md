## Building

- Clone the project
- Install [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/ 'Download MinGW') on Windows (haven't tested on other platforms)
- Navigate to the build folder of the project
- Run `mingw32-make` and the executable will be created in the build folder 
- This probably won't run in 90% of cases
  
___

## Plans

- Uses an entity system that i havent planned or tested (i cba to do either)
    - stores, updates, and renders all of the entities 
- Auto-generates random "maze-like" levels
    - funny algorithms that i dont understand go brrr
- enemies that shoot with different weapons
    - AR, pistol, sniper, etc.
- Powerups and weapons from chests
    - ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
- Insane difficulty curve
    - I despise people
